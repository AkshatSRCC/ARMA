# ARMA

In the statistical analysis of time series, autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models provide a parsimonious description of a (weakly) stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials, one for the autoregression (AR) and the second for the moving average (MA). 

The general ARMA model was described in the 1951 thesis of Peter Whittle.

The ARMA Process : 
Data = δ + φ ( Previous value ) + ( Random noise ) − θ ( Previous random noise ) 
Y t = δ + φ Y t − 1 + ε t − θ ε t − 1 
The long-term mean value of Y is δ / ( 1 − φ ) 

LLR Test :
In statistics, the likelihood-ratio test assesses the goodness of fit of two competing statistical models, specifically one found by maximization over the entire parameter space and another found after imposing some constraint, based on the ratio of their likelihoods.
